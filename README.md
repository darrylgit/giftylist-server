# giftylist-server

This is back end of an app to help families coordinate gift-buying this holiday season. Members of a group can upload their gift lists and check off items they're going to buy for each other, all while keeping it a secret from the gift recipients.

I came up with this idea on my own and then later realized [GIFTlistr](https://giftlistr.com/) does the exact same thing, so while this app wasn't originally intended to be a GIFTlistr clone, that's ultimately what it's going to wind up being.
